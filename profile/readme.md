# Langbase — Composable AI Developer Platform

⌘ Langbase is the composable AI infrastructure and developer experience to build, collaborate, and deploy any AI apps/features. The developer-friendly future of AI infra. We're obsessed with creating the best developer experience for building Gen AI products. We are engineers who love building tools for other engineers. We asked, can AI infra empower every developer? Imagine AI as accessible as `npm install`. Our mission: AI for all. Not just ML wizards. Every. Single. Developer.

We are the only composable AI infrastructure. That's all we do. In a way, Langbase is an open-source OpenAI alternative.
