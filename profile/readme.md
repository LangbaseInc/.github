# Langbase — AI Developer Cloud

Langbase is the most powerful serverless AI cloud for building and deploying AI agents.

Build, deploy, and scale serverless AI agents with tools and memory (RAG). Simple AI primitives no bloated frameworks, all with a world-class developer experience without using any frameworks.

> [Command.new](https://command.new) — can build agents for you, literally vibe code any ai agent.

## 🚀 Our Products

| Products | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [CommandCode.ai](https://commandcode.ai) | Command Code with your taste; the first coding agent that observes how you write code and adapts to your preferences over time using our `taste-1` meta neuro-symbolic AI model architecture. |
| [Command.new](https://command.new) | Vibe code any AI agent. Command turns prompts into prod-ready agents |
| [Pipe Agents](https://langbase.com/docs/pipe) | Pipes are a standard way to build serverless AI agents with tools and memory |
| [AI Memory](https://langbase.com/docs/memory) | Auto RAG AI primitive for agents to give them human like long-term memory |
| [Workflow](https://langbase.com/docs/workflow) | Build multi-step agents with built-in durable features like timeouts and retries |
| [Threads](https://langbase.com/docs/threads) | Store and manage AI agents context and conversation history without managing DBs |
| [Agent](https://langbase.com/docs/agent) | Agents is an AI primitive to build serverless agents with unified API over 600+ LLMs |
| [Parser](https://langbase.com/docs/parser) | AI primitive to extract text content from various document formats, for RAG |
| [Chunker](https://langbase.com/docs/chunker) | AI primitive to split text into smaller, manageable chunks for context, for RAG |
| [Embed](https://langbase.com/docs/embed) | AI primitive to convert text into vector embeddings unified API multiple models, for RAG |
| [Tools](https://langbase.com/docs/tools) | Pre-built and hosted tools for AI agents like web crawler and web search with Exa |
| [AI Studio](https://langbase.com/studio) | Langbase studio is your playground to build, collaborate, and deploy AI agents. Experiment on your agent changes and memory retrieval in real-time, with real data, store messages, version your prompts, optimize cost, see usage, and traces. Access [Langbase Studio](https://studio.langbase.com).<br><br>A complete AI developers platform.<br><br>- **Collaborate**: Invite all team members to collaborate on the pipe. Build AI together.<br>- **Developers & Stakeholders**: Work with all your R&D team, engineering, product, GTM (marketing and sales). It's like a powerful version of GitHub x Google Docs for AI. |
